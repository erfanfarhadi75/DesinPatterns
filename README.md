# Desin Patterns in typeScript  

I've been exploring design patterns through the Head First Design Patterns book, which primarily uses Java for its examples. To deepen my understanding and practice, I’ve created this repository to translate those examples into TypeScript.

I’m excited to share this work with you and welcome any contributions or questions you might have. Feel free to reach out if you have any ideas, suggestions, or need help with anything!
